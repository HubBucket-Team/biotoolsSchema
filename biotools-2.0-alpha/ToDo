### Guidelines / documentation 

0.  Think more about semantics of resource / interface type wrt consolidation of these into a single, inuititive set.
1.  Pull in text from schema 
2.  Pull in facets and patterns
3.  Pull in enumerations
4.  Pull in samples (to serve as examples ... although better to give real world examples)
5.  Then add things below ...


## General guidelines
1.  Resource IDs
How resource IDs are created (from serviceProviderName, tool/serviceName and version), where these data may be specified, and implications of changing them.  Persistence of pages.

2.  Resource type-specific guidelines
 Database
 Command-line tool
 Desktop GUI
 Web application
 Web service (REST/URL-based API)
 Web service (SOAP+WSDL)
 Workflow
 Galaxy/workbench instance
 Software suite/platform/distro
 Container
 Collection
 Library
 Plug-in


Database 
Tool (Command-line, Web application, Desktop GUI)
Service (REST/URL-based API, SOAP+WSDL)


3. Resource relationships
Tool isNewVersionOf Tool
Tool isOldVersionOf Tool

Service usesAsDataSource Database
Service uses             Tool

Platform includes Tool

# Element-specific guidelines

* <id> attribute
Describe the ID URL pattern used by bio.tools:
 bio.tools/toolName/version
 bio.tools/serviceProviderName/serviceName/
 bio.tools/database/databaseName/
"toolName" is identical to <name> (see below). 
"serviceProviderName" is provided upon registration, and is identical to bio.tools subdomain (if the registrant wants this).  The value is normally the standard acronym (e.g. EMBL-EBI) or short form name of the institute.  
"version" may be specified for tools only.  It is optional and is identical to <version> (see below).

* <name>
Describe the facet and regex in English.  What to do if the unique name has been taken. Stress this will be used in the resource ID and the implications of changing it.

* <homepage>
What to do for tools that do not have an obvious homepage (with an example of such).

* <description>
Style guidelines.  What this should / should not normally contain.

* <resourceType>
Include table explaining the enum, with examples of each type!  Explaim cases where more than 1 resource type could apply (e.g. a database, that provides an API and various Web apps), and that all types should be specified in such cases. 



* <version>
Describe the facet and regex in English.  Stress this will be used in the resource ID (if specified) and the implications of changing it.




# Schema ToDo
* Settle the URL pattern used by bio.tools (discuss with key folk)
* Pattern for <name> element: check it does not allow spaces. Ask others to check, once the syntax is finalised.
* Pattern for <description> element: what characters are not allowed?  And maybe change the basic type from xs:string if appropriate, to make this more restrictive.
* Settle the enum for resourceType
* Pattern for <version> element, bearing in mind it will be used in URL scheme





1.  ORCID simple type: specify type, pattern and sample (once I know what the valid ORCID syntax is)

2. github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsxsd update with tables or docs:
2.1 "roles" used by <credit> element: Developer, Maintainer, Other.
2.2 "roles" used by <contact> elements: General, Developer, Technical, Scientific, Maintainer, Helpdesk.

2.4 Meaning of <relationshipType> enum ,  using "Name of a collection which the resource was developed for or is maintained as part of, e.g. a suite, package, workbench, framework, library, registry, project, Web portal or any other list."

3. See if nesting 'choice' within 'sequence' (in contactDetails and creditDetails) is really necessary, or if we can just have the 'choice'.

4.  Add 'sample' value to PMID and PMCID

5. Add pattern to <id> attribute and relationship->id element defining the valid bio.tools URL.

6. Style and syntax of markdown text for specifying a command-line option <optionSummary> and <optionDescription>.

7. Style and syntax of markdown text for specifying a command-line description <commandLineDescription>.

8. Style and syntax for <endpointURLTemplate>, the markdown for this - and this should be compatible wiht the RFC standard (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) maybe.
