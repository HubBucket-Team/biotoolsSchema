# What is biotoolsSchema?

**biotoolsSchema** is a formalised XML schema (XSD) which defines a description model for bioinformatics software.  It can be used to describe bioinformatics tools - application software with well-defined data processing functions (inputs, outputs and operations).   This includes simple tools with one or a few closely related functions, and complex, multimodal tools with many functions.  A broad range of software types (see below) are covered including tools available for immediate use as online services, or in a form which which you can download, install, configure and run yourself.

biotoolsSchema defines 50 important scientific, technical and administrative attributes.  It concentrates upon the salient common features, with a minimal mandatory core of 3 attributes (name, description and homepage).  biotoolsSchema can help to support the cataloguing and discovery of software and is used by the ELIXIR Tools & Data Services Registry ( [bio.tools](https://bio.tools) ).

# Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is available (for version 3.0.0rc-rev1):
* [Technical docs](http://bio-tools.github.io/biotoolsSchema/) 
* [General docs](http://biotoolsschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)



# Information standard
biotoolsSchema together with the [EDAM ontology](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology) provide the foundation for a [tools information standard](https://github.com/bio-tools/Tool-Information-Standard) for the desription of tools.  It is being adopted by bio.tools and defines the attributes that must be defined within a 5-tier scale of entry completeness and quality.

# Software types 
biotoolsSchema is applicable to a broad range of [software types](http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#tool-type).
