# What is biotoolsSchema?
**biotoolsSchema** is a formalised XML schema (XSD) which defines a description model for bioinformatics software.  It can be used to describe bioinformatics tools - application software with well-defined data processing functions (inputs, outputs and operations).   This includes simple tools with one or a few closely related functions, and complex, multimodal tools with many functions.  A broad range of software types (see below) are covered including tools available for immediate use as online services, or in a form which which you can download, install, configure and run yourself.

biotoolsSchema defines 50 important scientific, technical and administrative attributes.  It concentrates upon the salient common features, with a minimal core of 7 attributes, mandating the necessary and sufficient information to support cataloguing and discovery of software.  It is used by the [ELIXIR Tools & Data Services Registry](https://bio.tools).

# Information standard
biotoolsSchema provides the foundation for a [tools information standard](https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsSchemaDocs/blob/master/information_requirement.rst#information-requirement) for the desription of tools.  It is being adopted by bio.tools and defines the attributes that must be defined for an entry to be labelled as a "minimal", "silver" and "gold" standard quality.

# Software types 
See the list of [software types](https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsSchemaDocs/blob/master/information_requirement.rst#tool-types) supported by the schema.
